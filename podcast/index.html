 <title>Dan &amp; Joe Show Episode 6 (Fixed)</title>
 <link>http://www.danandjoeshow.com/node/12</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In our first episode in 10 months, we cover all the latest on movies, TV shows, and games. As we teased, we might be back with information about iPads and other fun topics, but this podcast has lots of self-deprecating humor and lots of Dan&#039;s jokes that only he laughs at! Intro music features &quot;Cameras&quot; by Matt &amp;amp; Kim and the outro is the end jam of The Elms&#039;s &quot;Towers &amp;amp; The Trains&quot;. The music was playing over the talking about 5 minutes before the end but that is now fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dan &amp; Joe Show Episode 5</title>
 <link>http://www.danandjoeshow.com/node/10</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Dan &amp;amp; Joe Show is back! After about nine months of lapse, Joe and Dan are back with plenty of talk of movies, TV shows, and a bit of music.  Plus, this time we add talk of iPhones and concerts and Dan breathing into the microphone a lot. The intro is from Black Joe Lewis &amp;amp; The Honeybears (track &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;) and the show ends with &quot;Armistice (2nd Line Version)&quot; by Mute Math featuring Rebirth Brass Band.&lt;/p&gt;
